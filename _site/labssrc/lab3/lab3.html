    <h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

<p>This lab is an introduction to develop a real-time software based on FreeRTOS. You will design a simple digital watch which will help you to understand the FreeRTOS concepts effectively by applying them in practice. The lab covers the main concepts of FreeRTOS (task management, timer, inter-task communication, and resource management).</p>

<p>In the first part of the lab, you will learn how to create a FreeRTOS application, define tasks and configure them. By configuring, we mean to specify the tasks’ priority, period and etc. After defining the tasks, in the next three parts which are intertwined, (1) you will learn how to defines and use timers, (2) setup the communication between tasks using queues, and (3) use resource management techniques to manage the available resources and synchronize between tasks.</p>

<p>Following, first, we describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the watch and then present a brief guide for each part. You may try different ways to accomplish this lab as far as the final solution addresses the requirements.</p>

<p>Show results of your work to your instructor weekly.</p>

<h2 id="digital-watch-description">Digital Watch Description</h2>

<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>You need to use FreeRTOS windows simulator to develop your solution. Since you do not use real hardware, you will use the console (Windows cmd) as the watch display and use the keys (<code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>,<code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>,<code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code>,<code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code>) to provide inputs for your watch. Please note you can also use Arduino Board if you are interested.</p>

<h3 id="functional-requirements-of-the-digital-watch">Functional Requirements of the Digital Watch</h3>
<p>The watch should provide the following functionalities</p>

<p>The digital watch should provide the following functionalities</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Displaying Time:</strong> When the watch starts, it sets the time to 00:00:00. It then tracks the progress of time and displays it on the watch display (the command line). You cannot use the system API to read the system time and the watch should have a periodic task to track the progress of time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Stopwatch:</strong> Pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> toggles between the stopwatch mode and the normal mode. When the watch switches to the stopwatch mode, the stopwatch value should be shown on the display.  Pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> starts the stopwatch and pressing again stops it. Pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> resets the stopwatch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Alarm:</strong> Pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code>, allows the user to set an alarm by entering a time (hour and minutes). Obviously, the watch should start beeping when the alarms time is reached. The simplest way to implement the alarm is to use a software timer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="non-functional-requirements">Non-functional Requirements</h3>
<p>There are many ways to implement the functional requirements, however your solution should include the following features.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your solution should include 5 tasks.
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Core</strong> task which provides the core services and controls the watch.</li>
      <li><strong>TimeTracker</strong> task which tracks the progress of time.</li>
      <li><strong>Stopwatch</strong> task which provides the stopwatch services.</li>
      <li><strong>Display</strong> task that works as the gatekeeper for showing message on the display. None of the tasks can write directly to the command line. All requests should be sent to <em>Display</em> task.</li>
      <li><strong>Read-key</strong> task which manages reading the keys and passing them to the <em>Core</em> task.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The display, the keyboard, the time, and the stopwatch counter are shared resources that must be accessed exclusively. Use proper mutual exclusion solution when accessing these resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time resolution for the watch should be 500ms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stopwatch’s counter resolution should be 200ms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The watch must be displayed in the format <code class="highlighter-rouge">hh:mm:ss</code> and uodates every second.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stopwatch must be displayed in the format <code class="highlighter-rouge">hh:mm:ss:ms</code> where ms are the milliseconds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the naming convention of FreeRTOS.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="parts">Parts</h3>

<p>Do not try to implement all features of the watch at once. After defining the task configuration we recommend to implement the watch in three parts.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Develop a simple watch that only shows times. To do that you have to complete the implementation of the TimeTracker task which is a periodic task. Its period should be correlated to the watch resolution. Since you do not have the implementation of Display task, so to test this task using <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop Display, Read-key and Core tasks. Display task should read messages from a queue and print messages in the display. Read-Key is a periodic task that checks for input from a user and forwards the pressed keys to the Core task.  Read-Key should filter the pressed keys and pass only keys which are required to implement the watch. Finally, implement a Core task which receives keys from Read-Key task and controls the watch based on them. For instance switch to Stopwatch if <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> is pressed. Core task is required to communicate with other tasks to control the watch, so define related queues to manage the communication between Core task and others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop Stopwatch  and then integrate the Core task with TimeTracker and Stopwatch tasks. During this step, you need to define mutexes to manage the shared resources. The main logic for switching between different features (Stopwatch and TimeTracker) should be implemented by Core task. Finally, add the alarm functionality using a timer which  needs to be managed by the Core task.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>

<p>Here are some hints which may be helpful during implementation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">getch()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">scanf()</code> functions to read keys and values accordingly. Remember to <code class="highlighter-rouge">fflush(stdin)</code> after each use of them. To use <code class="highlighter-rouge">getch()</code> you have to include <code class="highlighter-rouge">conio.h</code>.</li>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf</code> for printing. Remember to <code class="highlighter-rouge">fflush(stdout)</code> after each use.</li>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Beep()</code> function for beeping which is required for the alarm service. You need to include <code class="highlighter-rouge">Windows.h</code>. Refer to the following <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms679277%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">link</a> for more detail.</li>
  <li>Required information to implement this lab is covered in the course material. You may also refer to the FreeRTOS books available <a href="https://freertos.org/Documentation/RTOS_book.html">here</a>.</li>
  <li>For the sake of clarification, we will demo a sample digital watch during the lab session.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="lab-report">Lab report</h2>

<p>Your lab report should include a cover page, a brief introduction, discussion and conclusion.</p>

<p>Your discussion should explain your design in detail (e.g., tasks configuration, how the priority and period of tasks are defined, how resources are shared and …)  and presents the behavior of each task using a state machine diagram.</p>

<p>Use the following format for your <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/docs/lab-report.docx">report</a>.</p>

<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>

<p>You must submit your lab report in <em>PDF</em> format and your code by e-mail in a <em>.zip</em> file.</p>
