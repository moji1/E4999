### General Description
The main objectives of the course are to provide for the students:
- an introduction to specifications, analysis, design, and development techniques for real-time software;
- a base foundation for the real-time operating system specifically [FreeRTOS](https://freertos.org/)
- a base foundation for modeling and development real-time systems using the UML-RT modeling language;
- practical experience with a [Papyrus-RT](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus-rt/), [Arduino boards](https://www.arduino.cc/), FreeRTOS; and
- an introduction to the theory of scheduling for multitasking systems in a single processor environment.

By the end of the course, the students will be able to analyze the requirements for a basic real-time system and to design and implement a solution using FreeRTOS or UML-RT. They should also be able to determine the schedulability of a simple multitasking system.


## Attendance
As indicated in the CadWins, attendance to classes is compulsory for all officer-cadets. Civilian students and grad students are encouraged to attend classes and must be present to labs. If you must absent yourself for a medical or other kind of appointment, you are required to ask and obtain permission from the instructor prior to the appointment. If you happen to get sick, do your utmost to inform the instructor in the briefest of delays.

## Academic Integrity
Infractions to academic integrity; including cheating, plagiarism and any other kinds of university ethics violations can lead to sanctions from a written warning to expulsion from RMC. The RMC rules concerning studies, section 4, define plagiarism as follows: "Using the work of others and attempting to present it as original thought, prose or work. This includes allegations that are false concerning data or references, and the abusive use of quotation marks or the mention of a source" and it also includes: "the omission to recognize adequately the collaboration or outside help". You should familiarize yourself with the rules with respect to academic misconduct available in [section 4 of the Academic Policy Directive No. 1 on Academic Integrity](https://www.rmcc-cmrc.ca/sites/default/files/1_Acad_integ-uni-bil.pdf).
