## Introduction 
In this tutorial, you get familiar with Papyrus-RT and start modeling using UML-RT language. Papyrus-RT is built on top of Papyrus and provides modeling facilities based on UML-RT and supports code generation in C++ from the UML-RT models. Also, it provides a run-time service library. Papyrus is an open source modeling tooling framework for UML which provides advanced facilities for making customized modeling tools. It has been customized for different UML profiles and purposes (e.g., SysML, MARTE, and information modeling) and has recently attracted considerable attention in the modeling communities.
